# Adoption-Center-Management

The following system is made to manage the adoption activity in the adoption center for cats and dogs.

The following tasks are being performed in the application here:

1. Animal adoption.
2. Sheltering rescued animals.
3. Keeping records of the adopted animals.

## Future-Modifications
This project can be modified by employing file handelling for storing animal records rather than a temporary record created every time application is run.
